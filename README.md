# react-ts-boiler-plate

React-ts-boiler-plate is a small boilerplate I made because I was getting sick of needing to set this up time and time again.

## Instructions:

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ThuverX/react-ts-boiler-plate
cd react-ts-boiler-plate

# Install all dependencies
yarn

# Run the development server
yarn serve --open
```
